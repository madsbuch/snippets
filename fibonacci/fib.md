# Fibonacci
The intention here is to implement the Fibonacci algorithm in natural
languages.

## English
Following is the implementation in direct recursion:

> Fibonacci of _n_ is defined to be the sum of Fibonacci of _n_ minus
> one, and _n_ minus two. We stop when we reach Fibonacci of zero
> and Fibonacci of one. They have the respective results zero and one.
