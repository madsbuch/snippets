    - Direct recursive
    - Accumulated recursion
* Haskell

    - Accumulated recursion
* Java
    - Direct recursive
    - Iterative
* PHP
    - Direct recursive
    - Iterative
* Scala
    - Direct Recursive
    - Accumulated recursion

## Benchmarking
One would think that having so many implementations of a function would provide
nicely for benchmarking languages and implementation. It does! I should do
something about it...

A quick thing though: Different languages have different goals. Consider
Coq and C. C would be considerable faster, but try proving program equivalence
in C.
