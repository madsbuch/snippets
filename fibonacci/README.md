# Fibonacci
implementations of Fibonacci.

## The list
* C
    - Iterative
    - Direct recursion
    - Dynamic programming (Memoization)
* Coq
    - Direct recursive
    - Accumulated recursion
* Haskell
    - Direct Recursive
    - Accumulated recursion
    - Continuation Passing Style
* Java
    - Direct recursive
    - Iterative
* PHP
    - Direct recursive
    - Iterative
* Scala
    - Direct Recursive
    - Accumulated recursion
    - Continuation Passing Style

## Benchmarking
One would think that having so many implementations of a function would provide
nicely for benchmarking languages and implementation. It does! I should do
something about it...

A quick thing though: Different languages have different goals. Consider
Coq and C. C would be considerable faster, but try proving program equivalence
in C.

## Styles
It is clear that the Fibonacci has been implemented in many various styles:

* Direct Recursion
* Accumulated Recursion
* Iterative
* Dynamic Programming
