## Benchmarking
One would think that having so many implementations of a function would provide
nicely for benchmarking languages and implementation. It does! I should do
something about it...

A quick thing though: Different languages have different goals. Consider
Coq and C. C would be considerable faster, but try proving program equivalence
in C.
